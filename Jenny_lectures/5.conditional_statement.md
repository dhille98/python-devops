# conditional stements in python 


---

## ✅ 1. `if` Statement

Used to execute a block **only if** the condition is `True`.

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
```

---

## ✅ 2. `if...else` Statement

Executes one block **if the condition is true**, otherwise executes another block.

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")
```

---

## ✅ 3. `if...elif...else` Statement

Used when you have **multiple conditions** to check.

```python
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

---

## ✅ 4. Nested `if` Statement

You can write `if` statements **inside another `if`**.

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    if x < 15:
        print("x is between 5 and 15")
```

---

## ✅ 5. Shorthand `if` and `if...else`

Used for simple one-liners.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5: print("x is greater than 5")

# Shorthand if-else
print("Even") if x % 2 == 0 else print("Odd")
```

---

## ✅ 6. Using Logical Operators

You can combine conditions using:

- `and` → both conditions must be true  
- `or` → at least one must be true  
- `not` → reverses the result

```python
a = 10
b = 5

if a > 5 and b < 10:
    print("Condition is True")
```
